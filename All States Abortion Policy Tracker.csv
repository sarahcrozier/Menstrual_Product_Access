"Notes"
"On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, overturning Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal standard protecting the right to abortion. With this decision, regulation of abortion is returned to the states. States are responding by implementing bans or protecting access to abortion.  For more information on state policies, please see our briefs on [state actions to protect abortion](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/state-actions-to-protect-and-expand-access-to-abortion-services/), [states without laws protecting or restricting abortion](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/reading-the-post-roe-tea-leaves-in-states-without-abortion-bans-or-protections/), our [brief on the Dobbs case](https://www.kff.org/report-section/abortion-at-scotus-dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-table/), and our [KFF State Health Facts page on abortion policies](https://www.kff.org/state-category/womens-health/abortion-statistics-and-policies/)."
