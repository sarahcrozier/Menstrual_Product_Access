## Analysis
✓ Description of the data exploration phase of the project

✓ Description of the analysis phase of the project


# <a name='Usage'></a>Machine Learning
We will begin our machine learning using the unsupervised learning method of clustering using K-means. This will help us determine the states that are adaquate and not adaquate.  Than we will use a logistic regression to determine if a county needs additional health clinics or if it has adequate access.
