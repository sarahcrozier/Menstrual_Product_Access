# Reproductive Health Access

The purpose of this project is to identify the current state of access to reproductive health available in the United States. 

## Key Questions

# Machine Learning Model
We will begin our machine learning using the unsupervised learning method of clustering using K-means. This will help us determine the states that are adaquate and not adaquate.  Than we will use a logistic regression to determine if a county needs additional health clinics or if it has adequate access.
