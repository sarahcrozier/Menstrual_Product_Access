"Notes"
"States have historically regulated insurance, and many have mandated minimum benefits for decades. Currently, 30 states require insurance plans to cover contraceptives, with a wide range of coverage and cost-sharing requirements, and exemptions among these mandates. Ten of these states and DC have passed laws expanding the ACA contraceptive coverage provision."
