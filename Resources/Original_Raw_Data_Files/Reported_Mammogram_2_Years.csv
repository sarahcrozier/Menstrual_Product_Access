"Notes"
"Data represent women age 40 and older who report having had a mammogram within the last two years."
""
"In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force updated its recommendation on mammography screening to recommend biennial mammograms for women aged 50 to 74 years.  The prior recommendation of the USPSTF issued in 2002 recommended mammography with or without clinical breast examination (CBE), every 1-2 years for women aged 40 and older. Under the Affordable Care Act, the standard for coverage of mammography screenings by private plans is the 2002 recommendation."
