"Notes"
"Abortion rate is the number of reported legal abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. As data are reported voluntarily by providers to state or area health departments, information may be incomplete and result in undercounting abortions when calculating rates and ratios in some states. Abortions by state of occurrence include abortions obtained by non-residents of the state as well as those obtained by residents. 2017 data not reported."

Footnotes
"1. Data from hospitals and licensed ambulatory care facilities only; because reporting is not mandatory for private physicians and women's centers, a complete count of abortions performed in New Jersey could not be obtained."
