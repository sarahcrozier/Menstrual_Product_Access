"Definitions"
"*Clinic Visits*: Health center visits are documented, face-to-face contact between a patient and a licensed or credentialed provider who exercises their independent, professional judgment in the provision of services to the patient. "
""
"*Virtual Visits*: Health center visits that are done virtually (via telemedicine) that would otherwise meet the criteria of a clinic visit. Virtual visits only include visits using synchronous telecommunication systems that permit real-time communication between the provider and a patient. These visits do not count other telemedicine modalities (e.g., store and forward, remote patient monitoring, mHealth, or provider-to-provider consultations)."
